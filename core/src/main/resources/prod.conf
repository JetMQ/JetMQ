//Including files
//Sometimes it can be useful to include another configuration file, for example if you have one application.conf with all environment independent settings and then override some settings for specific environments.
//
//Specifying system property with -Dconfig.resource=/dev.conf will load the dev.conf file, which includes the application.conf
//
//dev.conf:
//
//  include "application"
//
//akka {
//  loglevel = "DEBUG"
//}
